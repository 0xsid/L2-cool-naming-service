# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This is an in-progress Hardhat project to deploy a domain name service onto Polygon PoS. It consists of the smart contract, and the test for that contract, the script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts. The project is under active development.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
